# FizzbuzzCPP

#### Technologies: C++

## The Challenge ##
The challenge was to remake a simple “FizzBuzz” program that accepted one integer value into a method called fizzbuzz. Previous experience of Fizzbuzz when attending Makers Academy came in the form of a ruby iteration which I have saved [here](https://github.com/scass91/fizzbuzz).

The method checks for the following conditions: if the integer is divisible by 3 it returns ‘fizz’, if the integer is divisible by 5 it returns ‘buzz’, if the integer is divisible by 3 and 5 it returns ‘fizzbuzz’ and if none of the conditions are met it returns the integer. Example below
```shell
1 --> 1
2 --> 2
3 --> fizz
4 --> 4
5 --> buzz
6 --> fizz
7 --> 7
8 --> 8
9 --> fizz
10 --> buzz
11 --> 11
12 --> fizz
13 --> 13
14 --> 14
15 --> fizzbuzz
16 --> 16
17 --> 17
18 --> fizz
19 --> 19
20 --> buzz
```

## Why?
I want to challenge myself to see what a relatively common problem would be like in a lower level language. I have been exposed to RSpec up to this point for Ruby testing, I wanted to continue this TDD approach in a new language.

* C++ [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp)
* [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#top) for testing
* I found this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grC0S6ZK59U) very helpful when it came to testing with Catch2
